			<h1>Noel Is An <span>Alien</span></h1>
			<p>Aliens are oftenly defined as non existent sci-fi creatures. We've been denying every evidence about aliens so far, ignoring the fact that aliens coexisted with humans for a long time. Several tons of clues are out there to support the fact that aliens exist, from corpses to real-time footages of unidentified creatures. Me, as an observant human being found a specie that looks like a human but its not. It turns out that he's even my classmate. I've been observing him for about 3 years now, and I have concluded that outside, he looks like a normal average human being but inside, he's a totally different creature. His name is Noel Zyrence Saludo, a self proclaimed gamer who seeks and gains information about humans by observing their beharvior via gaming</p>
